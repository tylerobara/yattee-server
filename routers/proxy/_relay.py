"""Byte-relay proxy endpoint for playback.

Unlike ``/proxy/fast/{video_id}``, this endpoint takes the upstream URL
itself (HMAC-signed by the server at extraction time) and streams it
through to the client without yt-dlp re-extraction or on-disk caching.

Why a separate endpoint:

- ``/proxy/fast/`` re-runs yt-dlp on every request, which (a) re-downloads
  the whole file to ``/downloads/{id}_{itag}.{ext}`` before streaming and
  (b) fails outright when yt-dlp can't extract the video (e.g. ended live
  streams: ``This live event has ended``). For those, Invidious or
  InnerTube may have already returned a perfectly good URL, but the fast
  endpoint throws it away.

- The relay just streams bytes from upstream → client with full Range
  passthrough. Time-to-first-byte is small, seek works, and any URL the
  converter can produce (googlevideo, Invidious /videoplayback, an HLS
  variant manifest) is supported uniformly.

For HLS/DASH manifests, the relay rewrites segment URLs in the body so
segments also flow back through the relay (otherwise individual segments
would still hit googlevideo directly and could 403 for the same
client-IP-mismatch reason that motivated all of this).

``/proxy/fast/`` stays in place — it's still the right shape for
**downloads**, where caching the file on disk is desirable.
